# predictive-analysis-course

This respository consists of code for the Predictive Analysis Course at [SAIT](https://www.adecco.ca/en-ca/industries/accounting-and-finance/?display=10&utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=industries_accounting_finance&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4bipBhCyARIsAFsieCyigCCNPfKLmNq-lSJ_eCEjUCHL_YUZ1_iI4B0wW_ca_aRLbzT678saApBpEALw_wcB).

## Units 1 & 2 - Introduction to Data Science & R
In this unit we worked with basic objects in r: variables, vectors, matrices, lists, and dataframes.

## Unit 3 - Data Wrangling
In this unit we learned about strategies to clean and wrangle data using the tidyverse packages in R, and learned how to do basic visualizations with ggplot.

## Unit 4 - SQL
In this unit we learned to connect R to SQL and execute SQL queries from within R studio.

## Unit 5 - Supervised Learning
In this unit we have learned three types of supervised learning: linear regression, polynomial regression, and K Nearest Neighbours.

## Unit 6 - Unsupervised Learning
In this unit we learned how to do clustering in R.

## Unit 7 - Time Series Analysis
In this unit we learned how to do time series analysis. This involved learning to convert dataframes to time series objects, how to produce decomposition plots, and how to use the arima model to forecast future values.
